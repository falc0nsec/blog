This blog focused is mainly focused on Linux and Open Source based on my personal experiences and expertise. My favourite distribution has been ArchLinux + i3 and I am now moved to Artix + DWM. I am using [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/) currently. I am also planning to customize it and hopefully create my own rice.

Probably at the beginning, my writting skills are far from good, just be patience .. Everybody learns by doing.

If you have any feedback, good or bad, just drop me an email. I would appreciate if you can use my GPG key for that matter.
