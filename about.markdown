This blog focused mostly on Linux and Open Source which I have explored or I will. My favourite distribution has been ArchLinux + i3 and I am now moved to Artix + DWM. I am using [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/) though I also planning to customize it and finally create my own rice.

Probably at the beginning, my writting skills are far from good, just be patience .. Everybody learns by doing.

If you have any feedback, good or bad, just sent me an email. I would appreciate you using my GPG key for that matter.
